### [EuroBSDCon and AsiaBSDCon](http://2014.eurobsdcon.org/calendar/call-for-papers/) ###

* This year, EuroBSDCon will be in September in Sofia, Bulgaria
* They've got a call for papers up now, so everyone can submit the talks they want to present
* There will also be a tutorial section of the conference
* [AsiaBSDCon](http://2014.asiabsdcon.org/timetable.html.en) will be next month, in March!

### [FreeBSD 10 on Ubiquiti EdgeRouter Lite](http://rtfm.net/FreeBSD/ERL/) ###

* The Ubiquiti EdgeRouter Lite is a router that costs less than $100 and has a MIPS CPU
* This article goes through the process of installing and configuring FreeBSD on it to use as a home router
* Lots of good pictures of the hardware and specific details needed to get you set up
* It also includes the scripts to create your own images if you don't want to use the ones rolled by someone else
* For such a cheap price, might be a really fun weekend project to replace your shitty consumer router
* Of course if you're more of an OpenBSD guy, you can always see [our tutorial](http://www.bsdnow.tv/tutorials/openbsd-router) for that too \*\*\*

### [Signed pkgsrc package guide](http://blog.saveosx.org/signed-packages/) ###

* We got a request on IRC for more pkgsrc stuff on the show, and a listener provided a nice write-up
* It shows you how to set up signed packages with pkgsrc, which works on quite a few OSes (not just NetBSD)
* He goes through the process of signing packages with a public key and how to verify the packages when you install them
* The author also happens to be an EdgeBSD developer \*\*\*

### [Big batch of OpenBSD hackathon reports](http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20140212083627) ###

* Five trip reports from the OpenBSD hackathon in New Zealand! In the first one, jmatthew details his work on fiber channel controller drivers, some octeon USB work and ARM fixes for AHCI
* In [the second](http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20140213065843), ketennis gets into his work with running interrupt handlers without holding the kernel lock, some SPARC64 improvements and a few other things
* In [the third](http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20140213173808), jsg updated libdrm and mesa and did various work on xenocara
* In [the fourth](http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20140214070023), dlg came with the intention to improve SMP support, but got distracted and did SCSI stuff instead - but he talks a little bit about the struggle OpenBSD has with SMP and some of the work he's done
* In [the fifth](http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20140214130039), claudio talks about some stuff he did for routing tables and misc. other things \*\*\*

* Our friend [Colin Percival](http://www.bsdnow.tv/episodes/2014_01_22-tendresse_for_ten) details how to build EC2 images in a new blog post
* Most people just use the images he makes on their instances, but some people will want to make their own [from scratch](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/user/cperciva/EC2-build/)
* You build a regular disk image and then turn it into an AMI
* It requires a couple ports be installed on your system, but the whole process is pretty straightforward \*\*\*
