Headlines
----------

### [BSD Devroom CFP](https://lists.fosdem.org/pipermail/fosdem/2014-October/002038.html) ###

* This year's FOSDEM conference (Belgium, Jan 31st - Feb 1st) is having a dedicated BSD devroom
* They've issued a call for papers on anything BSD-related, and we always love more presentations
* If you're in the Belgium area or plan on going, submit a talk about something cool you're doing
* There's also [a mailing list](https://lists.fosdem.org/listinfo/bsd-devroom) and some more information in the original post \*\*\*

### [Bhyve SVM code merge](https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-virtualization/2014-October/002905.html) ###

* The bhyve\_svm code has been in the "projects" tree of FreeBSD, but is [now ready](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&revision=273375) for -CURRENT
* This changeset will finally allow bhyve to run on AMD CPUs, where it was previously limited to Intel only
* All the supported operating systems and utilities should work on both now
* One thing to note: bhyve doesn't support PCI passthrough on AMD just yet
* There may still be [some issues](https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-virtualization/2014-October/002935.html) though \*\*\*

### [NetBSD at Open Source Conference Tokyo](https://mail-index.netbsd.org/netbsd-advocacy/2014/10/20/msg000671.html) ###

* The Japanese NetBSD users group held a booth at another recent open source conference
* As always, they were running NetBSD on everything you can imagine
* One of the users reports back to the mailing list on their experience, providing lots of pictures and links
* Here's an interesting [screenshot of NetBSD running various other BSDs in Xen](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B0NnfcbCEAAmKIU.jpg:large) \*\*\*

### [More BSD switchers every day](https://www.reddit.com/r/unix/comments/2il383/question_about_the_bsd_community_as_a_whole/) ###

* A decade-long Linux user is considering making the switch, and asks Reddit about the BSD community
* Tired of the pointless bickering he sees in his current community, he asks if the same problems exist over here and what he should expect
* So far, he's found that BSD people seem to act more level-headed about things, and are much more practical, whereas some FSF/GNU/GPL people make open source a religion
* There's also [another semi-related thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/BSD/comments/2jpxj9/question_about_the_current_state_of_freebsd/) about another Linux user wanting to switch to BSD because of systemd and GNU people
* There are some extremely well written and thought-out comments in the replies (in both threads), be sure to give them all a read
* Maybe the OPs should've just watched this show \*\*\*

News Roundup
----------

### [FreeBSD -CURRENT on a T420](https://www.banym.de/freebsd/install-freebsd-11-on-thinkpad-t420) ###

* Thinkpads are quite popular with BSD developers and users
* Most of the hardware seems to be supported across the BSDs (especially wifi)
* This article walks through installing FreeBSD -CURRENT on a Thinkpad T420 with UEFI
* If you've got a Thinkpad, or especially this specific one, have a look at some of the steps involved \*\*\*

### [FreeNAS on a Supermicro 5018A-MHN4](https://www.teckelworks.com/2014/10/building-a-freenas-server-with-a-supermicro-5018a-mhn4/) ###

* More and more people are migrating their NAS devices to BSD-based solutions
* In this post, the author goes through setting up FreeNAS on some of his new hardware
* His new rack-mounted FreeNAS machine has a low power Atom with eight cores and 64GB of RAM - quite a lot for its small form factor
* The rest of the post details all of the hardware he chose and goes through the build process (with lots of cool pictures) \*\*\*

### [Hardening procfs and linprocfs](http://hardenedbsd.org/article/shawn-webb/2014-10-15/hardening-procfs-and-linprocfs) ###

* There was an exploit published recently for SFTP in OpenSSH, but it mostly just affected Linux
* There exists a native procfs in FreeBSD, which was the target point of that exploit, but it's not used very often
* The Linux emulation layer also supports its own linprocfs, which was affected as well
* The HardenedBSD guys weigh in on how to best solve the problem, and now support an additional protection layer from writing to memory with procfs
* If you want to learn more about ASLR and HardenedBSD, be sure to check out [our interview with Shawn](http://www.bsdnow.tv/episodes/2014_08_27-reverse_takeover) too \*\*\*

### [pfSense monitoring with bandwidthd](http://pfsensesetup.com/bandwidth-monitoring-with-bandwidthd/) ###

* A lot of people run pfSense on their home network, and it's really useful to monitor the bandwidth usage
* This article will walk you through setting up bandwidthd to do exactly that
* bandwidthd monitors based on the IP address, rather than per-interface
* It can also build some cool HTML graphs, and we love those pfSense graphs
* Have a look at our [bandwidth monitoring and testing](http://www.bsdnow.tv/tutorials/vnstat-iperf) tutorial for some more ideas \*\*\*
