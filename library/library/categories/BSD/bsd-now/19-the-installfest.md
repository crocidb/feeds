Headlines
----------

### [FreeBSD's new testing infrastructure](https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-hackers/2013-December/044009.html) ###

* A new test suite was added to FreeBSD, with 3 powerful machines available
* Both -CURRENT and stable/10 have got the test suite build infrastructure in place
* Designed to help developers test and improve major scalability across huge amounts of CPUs and RAM
* More details [available here](http://julipedia.meroh.net/2013/12/introducing-freebsd-test-suite.html)
* Could the iXsystems monster server be involved...? \*\*\*

### [OpenBSD gets signify](http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&m=138845902916897&w=2) ###

* At long last, OpenBSD gets support for signed releases!
* For "the world's most secure OS" it was very easy to MITM kernel patches, updates, installer isos, everything
* A commit to the -current tree reveals a new "signify" tool is currently being kicked around
* More details in [a blog post](http://www.tedunangst.com/flak/post/signify) from the guy who committed it
* Quote: "yeah, briefly, the plan is to sign sets and packages. that's still work in progress." \*\*\*

### [Faces of FreeBSD](http://freebsdfoundation.blogspot.ca/2013/12/faces-of-freebsd-isabell-long.html) ###

* This time they interview Isabell Long
* She's a volunteer staff member on the freenode IRC network
* In 2011, she participated in the Google Code-In contest and became involved with documentation
* "The new committer mentoring process proved very useful and that, plus the accepting community of FreeBSD, are reasons why I stay involved." \*\*\*

### [pkgsrc-2013Q4 branched](http://mail-index.netbsd.org/pkgsrc-users/2013/12/31/msg019107.html) ###

* The quarterly pkgsrc branch from NetBSD is out
* 13472 total packages for NetBSD-current/amd64 + 13049 binary packages built with clang!
* Lots of numbers and stats in the announcement
* pkgsrc works on quite a few different OSes, not just NetBSD
* See [our interview](http://www.bsdnow.tv/episodes/2013_11_20-collecting_shells) with Amitai Schlair for a bit about pkgsrc \*\*\*

### [OpenBSD on Google's Compute Engine](http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-misc&m=138610199311393&w=2) ###

* Google Compute Engine is a "cloud computing" platform similar to EC2
* Unfortunately, they only offer poor choices for the OS (Debian and CentOS)
* Recently it's been announced that there is a custom OS option
* It's using a WIP virtio-scsi driver, lots of things still need more work
* Lots of technical and networking details about the struggles to get OpenBSD working on it \*\*\*

News Roundup
----------

### [Building an OpenBSD wireless access point](http://ctors.net/2013/12/30/openbsd_wireless_access_point) ###

* A neat write up we found around the internet about making an OpenBSD wifi router
* Goes through the process of PXE booting, installing base, using a serial console, setting up networking and wireless
* Even includes a puffy sticker on the Soekris box at the end, how cute \*\*\*

### [FreeBSD 4.X jails on 10.0](http://blather.michaelwlucas.com/archives/1919) ###

* Blog entry from our buddy [Michael Lucas](http://www.bsdnow.tv/episodes/2013_11_06-year_of_the_bsd_desktop)
* For whatever reason (an "in-house application"), he needed to run a FreeBSD 4 jail in FreeBSD 10
* Talks about the options he had: porting software, virtualizing, dealing with slow old hardware
* He goes through the whole process of making an ancient jail
* It's "an acceptable trade-off, if it means I don’t have to touch actual PHP code." \*\*\*

### [Unscrewed: a story about OpenBSD](http://www.skeptech.org/blog/2013/01/13/unscrewed-a-story-about-openbsd/) ###

* Pretty long blog post about how a network admin used OpenBSD to save the day
* To set the tone, "It was 5am, and the network was down"
* Great war story about replacing expensive routers and networking equipment with cheaper hardware and BSD
* Mentions a lot of the built in tools and how OpenBSD is great for routers and high security applications \*\*\*

### [PCBSD weekly digest](http://blog.pcbsd.org/2014/01/pc-bsd-weekly-feature-digest-2/) ###

* 10.0-RC3 is out and ready to be tested
* New detection of ATI Hybrid Graphics, they're working on nVidia next
* Re-classifying Linux jails as unsupported / experimental \*\*\*
