It's our one year anniversary episode, and we'll be talking with Reyk Floeter about the new OpenBSD webserver - why it was created and where it's going. After that, we'll show you the ins and outs of DragonFly's HAMMER FS. Answers to viewer-submitted questions and the latest headlines, on a very special BSD Now - the place to B.. SD.

Headlines
----------

### [FreeBSD foundation's new IPSEC project](http://freebsdfoundation.blogspot.com/2014/08/freebsd-foundation-announces-ipsec.html) ###

* The FreeBSD foundation, along with Netgate, is sponsoring some new work on the IPSEC code
* With bandwidth in the 10-40 gigabit per second range, the IPSEC stack needs to be brought up to modern standards in terms of encryption and performance
* This new work will add AES-CTR and AES-GCM modes to FreeBSD's implementation, borrowing some code from OpenBSD
* The updated stack will also support AES-NI for hardware-based encryption speed ups
* It's expected to be completed by the end of September, and will also be in pfSense 2.2 \*\*\*

### [NetBSD at Shimane Open Source Conference 2014](http://mail-index.netbsd.org/netbsd-advocacy/2014/08/31/msg000667.html) ###

* The Japanese NetBSD users group held a NetBSD booth at the Open Source Conference 2014 in Shimane on August 23
* One of the developers has gathered a bunch of pictures from the event and wrote a fairly lengthy summary
* They had NetBSD running on all sorts of devices, from Raspberry Pis to Sun Java Stations
* Some visitors said that NetBSD had the most chaotic booth at the conference \*\*\*

### [pfSense 2.1.5 released](https://blog.pfsense.org/?p=1401) ###

* A new version of the pfSense 2.1 branch is out
* Mostly a security-focused release, including three web UI fixes and the most recent OpenSSL fix (which FreeBSD has [still not patched](https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-security/2014-August/007875.html) in -RELEASE after nearly a month)
* It also includes many other bug fixes, check the blog post for the full list \*\*\*

### [Systems, Science and FreeBSD](http://msrvideo.vo.msecnd.net/rmcvideos/227133/dl/227133.mp4) ###

* Our friend [George Neville-Neil](http://www.bsdnow.tv/episodes/2014_01_29-journaled_news_updates) gave a presentation at Microsoft Research
* It's mainly about using FreeBSD as a platform for research, inside and outside of universities
* The talk describes the OS and its features, ports, developer community, documentation, who uses BSD and much more \*\*\*

News Roundup

### [OpenBSD's rcctl tool usage](http://brynet.biz.tm/article-rcctl.html) ###

* OpenBSD recently [got a new tool](http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20140820090351) for managing /etc/rc.conf.local in -current
* Similar to FreeBSD's "sysrc" tool, it eliminates the need to manually edit rc.conf.local to enable or disable services
* This blog post - from a BSD Now viewer - shows the typical usage of the new tool to alter the startup services
* It won't make it to 5.6, but will be in 5.7 (next May) \*\*\*

### [pfSense mini-roundup](http://mateh.id.au/2014/08/stream-netflix-chromecast-using-pfsense/) ###

* We found five interesting pfSense articles throughout the week and wanted to quickly mention them
* The first item in our pfSense mini-roundup details how you can stream Netflix to in non-US countries using a "smart" DNS service
* The [second post](http://theosquest.com/2014/08/28/ipv6-with-comcast-and-pfsense/) talks about setting ip IPv6, in particular if Comcast is your ISP
* The [third one](http://news.softpedia.com/news/PfSense-2-1-5-Is-Free-and-Powerful-FreeBSD-based-Firewall-Operating-System-457097.shtml) features pfSense on Softpedia, a more mainstream tech site
* The [fourth post](http://sichent.wordpress.com/2014/02/22/filtering-https-traffic-with-squid-on-pfsense-2-1/) describes how to filter HTTPS traffic with Squid and pfSense
* The [last article](http://pfsensesetup.com/vpn-tunneling-with-tinc/) describes setting up a VPN using the "[tinc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinc_(protocol))" daemon and pfSense
* It seems to be lesser known, compared to things like OpenVPN or SSH tunnels, so it's interesting to read about
* This pfSense HQ website seems to have lots of other cool pfSense items, check it out \*\*\*

### [OpenBSD's new buffer cache](http://www.tedunangst.com/flak/post/2Q-buffer-cache-algorithm) ###

* OpenBSD has traditionally used the tried-and-true LRU algorithm for buffer cache, but it has a few problems
* [Ted Unangst](http://www.bsdnow.tv/episodes/2014_02_05-time_signatures) has just switched to a new algorithm in -current, partially based on 2Q, and details some of his work
* Initial tests show positive results in terms of cache responsiveness
* Check the post for all the fine details \*\*\*

### [BSDTalk episode 244](http://bsdtalk.blogspot.com/2014/08/bsdtalk244-lumina-desktop-environment.html) ###

* Another new BSDTalk is up and, this time around, [Will Backman](http://www.bsdnow.tv/episodes/2014_03_05-bsd_now_vs_bsdtalk) interviews Ken Moore, the developer of the new BSD desktop environment
* They discuss the history of development, differences between it and other DEs, lots of topics
* If you're more of a visual person, fear not, because...
* We'll have Ken on *next week*, including a full "virtual walkthrough" of Lumina and its applications \*\*\*
