Coming up this week, we'll be talking with Adrian Chadd about all things wireless, his experience with FreeBSD on various laptop hardware and a whole lot more. As usual, we've got the latest news and answers to all your emails, on BSD Now - the place to B.. SD.

Headlines
----------

### [FreeBSD 10.1-BETA1 is out](http://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/ISO-IMAGES/10.1/) ###

* The first maintenance update in the 10.x series of FreeBSD is on its way
* Since we can't see a changelog yet, the 10-STABLE [release notes](https://www.freebsd.org/relnotes/10-STABLE/relnotes/article.html) offer a glimpse at some of the new features and fixes that will be included in 10.1
* The vt driver was merged from -CURRENT, lots of drivers were updated, lots of bugs were fixed and bhyve also got many improvements from 11
* Initial UEFI support, multithreaded softupdates for UFS and many more things were added
* You can check the [release schedule](https://www.freebsd.org/releases/10.1R/schedule.html) for the planned release dates
* Details for the various forms of release media can be found in [the announcement](https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-stable/2014-September/080106.html) \*\*\*

### [Remote headless OpenBSD installation](https://jcs.org/notaweblog/2014/09/12/remotely_installing_openbsd_on_a/) ###

* A lot of server providers only offer a limited number of operating systems to be easily installed on their boxes
* Sometimes you'll get lucky and they'll offer FreeBSD, but it's much harder to find ones that natively support other BSDs
* This article shows how you can use a Linux-based rescue system, a RAM disk and QEMU to install OpenBSD on the bare metal of a server, headlessly and remotely
* It required a few specific steps you'll want to take note of, but is **extremely useful** for those pesky hosting providers \*\*\*

### [Building a firewall appliance with pfSense](http://www.get-virtual.net/2014/09/16/build-firewall-appliance/) ###

* In this article, we learn how to easily set up a gateway and wireless access point with pfSense on a Netgate [ALIX2C3 APU](http://pcengines.ch/alix2c3.htm)
* After the author's modem died, he decided to look into a more do-it-yourself option with pf and a tiny router board
* The hardware he used has gigabit ports and a BSD-compatible wireless card, as well as enough CPU power for a modest workload and a few services (OpenVPN, etc.)
* There's a lot of *great* pictures of the hardware and detailed screenshots, definitely worth a look \*\*\*

### [Receive Side Scaling - UDP testing](http://adrianchadd.blogspot.com/2014/09/receive-side-scaling-testing-udp.html) ###

* Adrian Chadd has been working on RSS (Receive Side Scaling) in FreeBSD, and gives an update on the progress
* He's using some quad core boxes with 10 gigabit ethernet for the tests
* The post gives lots of stats and results from his network benchmark, as well as some interesting workarounds he had to do
* He also provides some system configuration options, sysctl knobs, etc. (if you want to try it out)
* And speaking of Adrian Chadd... \*\*\*

News Roundup
----------

### [Sendmail removed from OpenBSD](http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20140916084251) ###

* Mail server admins around the world [are rejoicing](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8324475), because sendmail is [finally gone](http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&m=141081997917153&w=2) from OpenBSD
* With OpenSMTPD being a part of the base system, sendmail became largely redundant and unneeded
* If you've ever compared a "sendmail.cf" file to an "smtpd.conf" file... the different is as clear as night and day
* 5.6 will serve as a transitional release, including both sendmail and OpenSMTPD, but 5.7 will be the first release without it
* If you still need it for some reason, sendmail will live in ports from now on
* Hopefully FreeBSD will follow suit sometime in the future as well, possibly including DragonFly's mail transfer agent in base (instead of an entire mail server) \*\*\*

### [pfSense backups with pfmb](https://github.com/zinkwazi/pfmb) ###

* We've mentioned the need for a tool to back up pfSense configs a number of times on the show
* This script, hosted on github, does pretty much exactly that
* It can connect to one (or more!) pfSense installations and back up the configuration
* You can roll back or replace failed hardware very easily with its restore function
* Everything is done over SSH, so it should be pretty secure \*\*\*

### [The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321968972/) ###

* We mentioned when the pre orders were up, but now "The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System, 2nd edition" seems to be shipping out
* If you're interested in FreeBSD development, or learning about the operating system internals, this is a great book to buy
* We've even had [all](http://www.bsdnow.tv/episodes/2013-10-02_stacks_of_cache) [three](http://www.bsdnow.tv/episodes/2014_01_29-journaled_news_updates) [authors](http://www.bsdnow.tv/episodes/2014_08_13-vpn_my_dear_watson) on the show before! \*\*\*

### [OpenBSD's systemd replacement updates](http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20140915064856) ###

* We mentioned last week that the news of OpenBSD creating systemd wrappers was getting mainstream attention
* One of the developers writes in to Undeadly, detailing what's going on and what the overall status is
* He also clears up any confusion about "porting systemd to BSD" **(that's not what's going on)** or his code ever ending up in base **(it won't)**
* The top comment as of right now is a Linux user asking if his systemd wrappers can be ported back to Linux... poor guy \*\*\*
