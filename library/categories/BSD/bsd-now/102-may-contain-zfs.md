This week on the show, we'll be talking with Peter Toth. He's got a jail management system called "iocage" that's been getting pretty popular recently. Have we finally found a replacement for ezjail? We'll see how it stacks up.

Headlines

### [FreeBSD on Olimex RT5350F-OLinuXino](https://www.bidouilliste.com/blog/2015/07/22/FreeBSD-on-Olimex-RT5350F-OLinuXino) ###

* If you haven't heard of the RT5350F-OLinuXino-EVB, you're not alone (actually, we probably couldn't even remember the name if we did know about it)
* It's a small board with a MIPS CPU, two ethernet ports, wireless support and... 32MB of RAM
* This blog series documents installing FreeBSD on the device, but it is quite a DIY setup at the moment
* In [part two of the series](https://www.bidouilliste.com/blog/2015/07/24/FreeBSD-on-Olimex-RT5350F-OLinuXino-Part-2), he talks about the GPIO and how you can configure it
* Part three is still in the works, so check the site later on for further progress and info \*\*\*

### [The modern OpenBSD home router](https://www.azabani.com/2015/08/06/modern-openbsd-home-router.html) ###

* In a new series of blog posts, one guy takes you through the process of building an [OpenBSD-based gateway](http://www.bsdnow.tv/tutorials/openbsd-router) for his home network
* "It’s no secret that most consumer routers ship with software that’s flaky at best, and prohibitively insecure at worst"
* Armed with a 600MHz Pentium III CPU, he shows the process of setting up basic NAT, firewalling and even getting hostap mode working for wireless
* This guide also covers PPP and IPv6, in case you have those requirements
* In a [similar but unrelated series](http://jaytongarnett.blogspot.com/2015/07/openbsd-router-bt-home-hub-5-replacement.html), another user does a similar thing - his post also includes details on reusing your consumer router as a wireless bridge
* He also has [a separate post](http://jaytongarnett.blogspot.com/2015/08/openbsd-l2tpipsec-vpn-works-with.html) for setting up an IPSEC VPN on the router \*\*\*

### [NetBSD at Open Source Conference 2015 Kansai](https://mail-index.netbsd.org/netbsd-advocacy/2015/08/10/msg000691.html) ###

* The Japanese NetBSD users group has teamed up with the Kansai BSD users group and Nagoya BSD users group to invade another conference
* They had NetBSD running on all the usual (unusual?) devices, but some of the other BSDs also got a chance to shine at the event
* Last time they mostly had ARM devices, but this time the centerpiece was an OMRON LUNA88k
* They had at least one FreeBSD and OpenBSD device, and at least one NetBSD device even had Adobe Flash running on it
* And what conference would be complete without an LED-powered towel \*\*\*

### [OpenSSH 7.0 released](https://lists.mindrot.org/pipermail/openssh-unix-dev/2015-August/034289.html) ###

* The OpenSSH team has just finished up the 7.0 release, and the focus this time is deprecating legacy code
* SSHv1 support is disabled, 1024 bit diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 KEX is disabled and the v00 cert format authentication is disabled
* The syntax for permitting root logins has been changed, and is now called "prohibit-password" instead of "without-password" (this makes it so root can login, but only with keys) - all interactive authentication methods for root are also disabled by default now
* If you're using an older configuration file, the "without-password" option still works, so no change is required
* You can now control which public key types are available for authentication, as well as control which public key types are offered for host authentications
* Various bug fixes and documentation improvements are also included
* Aside from the keyboard-interactive and PAM-related bugs, this release includes one minor security fix: TTY permissions were too open, so users could write messages to other logged in users
* In the *next release*, even more deprecation is planned: RSA keys will be refused if they're under 1024 bits, CBC-based ciphers will be disabled and the MD5 HMAC will also be disabled \*\*\*

News Roundup
----------

### [More c2k15 reports](http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20150809105132) ###

* A few more hackathon reports from c2k15 in Calgary are still slowly trickling in
* Alexander Bluhm's up first, and he continued improving OpenBSD's regression test suite (this ensures that no changes accidentally break existing things)
* He also worked on syslogd, completing the TCP input code - the syslogd in 5.8 will have TLS support for secure remote logging
* Renato Westphal [sent in a report](http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20150811171006) of his very first hackathon
* He finished up the VPLS implementation and worked on EIGRP (which is explained in the report) - the end result is that OpenBSD will be more easily deployable in a Cisco-heavy network
* Philip Guenther [also wrote in](http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20150809165912), getting some very technical and low-level stuff done at the hackathon
* His report opens with "First came a diff to move the grabbing of the kernel lock for soft-interrupts from the ASM stubs to the C routine so that mere mortals can actually push it around further to reduce locking." - not exactly beginner stuff
* There were also some C-state, suspend/resume and general ACPI improvements committed, and he gives a long list of random other bits he worked on as well \*\*\*

### [FreeBSD jails, the hard way](https://clinta.github.io/freebsd-jails-the-hard-way) ###

* As you learned from our interview this week, there's quite a selection of tools available to manage your jails
* This article takes the opposite approach, using only the tools in the base system: ZFS, nullfs and jail.conf
* Unlike with iocage, ZFS isn't actually a requirement for this method
* If you are using it, though, you can make use of snapshots for making template jails \*\*\*

### [OpenSSH hardware tokens](http://www.tancsa.com/mdtblog/?p=73) ###

* We've talked about a number of ways to do two-factor authentication with SSH, but what if you want it on both the client *and* server?
* This blog post will show you how to use a hardware token as a second authentication factor, for the "something you know, something you have" security model
* It takes you through from start to finish: formatting the token, generating keys, getting it integrated with sshd
* Most of this will apply to any OS that can run ssh, and the token used in the example can be found online for pretty cheap too \*\*\*

### [LibreSSL 2.2.2 released](http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/LibreSSL/libressl-2.2.2-relnotes.txt) ###

* The LibreSSL team has released version 2.2.2, which signals the end of the 5.8 development cycle and includes many fixes
* At the c2k15 hackathon, developers uncovered dozens of problems in the OpenSSL codebase with the Coverity code scanner, and this release incorporates all those: dead code, memory leaks, logic errors (which, by the way, you really don't want in a crypto tool...) and much more
* SSLv3 support was removed from the "openssl" command, and only a few other SSLv3 bits remain - once workarounds are found for ports that specifically depend on it, it'll be removed completely
* Various other small improvements were made: DH params are now 2048 bits by default, more old workarounds removed, cmake support added, etc
* It'll be in 5.8 (due out earlier than usual) and it's in the FreeBSD ports tree as well \*\*\*
