This time on the show, we'll be chatting with Jed Reynolds about ZFS. He's been using it extensively on a certain other OS, and we can both learn a bit about the other side's implementation. Answers to your questions and all this week's news, coming up on BSD Now - the place to B.. SD.

Headlines

### [Playing with sandboxing](http://blog.conviso.com.br/2015/05/playing-with-sandbox-analysis-of_13.html) ###

* Sandboxing and privilege separation are popular topics these days - they're the goal of the new "shill" scripting language, they're used heavily throughout OpenBSD, and they're gaining traction with the capsicum framework
* This blog post explores capsicum in FreeBSD, some of its history and where it's used in the base system
* They also include some code samples so you can verify that capsicum is actually denying the program access to certain system calls
* Check our [interview about capsicum](http://www.bsdnow.tv/episodes/2014_05_28-the_friendly_sandbox) from a while back if you haven't seen it already \*\*\*

### [OpenNTPD on by default](https://www.marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&m=143195693612629&w=4) ###

* OpenBSD has enabled [ntpd](http://www.bsdnow.tv/episodes/2015_02_11-time_for_a_change) by default in the installer, rather than prompting the user if they want to turn it on
* In nearly every case, you're going to want to have your clock synced via NTP
* With the HTTPS constraints feature also enabled by default, this should keep the time checked and accurate, even against spoofing attacks
* Lots of problems can be traced back to the time on one system or another being wrong, so this will also eliminate some of those cases
* For those who might be [curious](http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/etc/ntpd.conf), they're using the "[pool.ntp.org](http://www.pool.ntp.org/en/)" cluster of addresses and google for HTTPS constraints (but these can be [easily changed](http://www.bsdnow.tv/tutorials/ntpd)) \*\*\*

### [FreeBSD workshop in Landshut](https://www.banym.de/freebsd/review-first-freebsd-workshop-in-landshut-on-15-may-2015) ###

* We mentioned a BSD installfest happening in Germany a few weeks back, and the organizer wrote in with a review of the event
* The installfest instead became a "FreeBSD workshop" session, introducing curious new users to some of the flagship features of the OS
* They covered when to use UFS or ZFS, firewall options, the release/stable/current branches and finally how to automate installations with Ansible
* If you're in south Germany and want to give similar introduction talks or Q&A sessions about the other BSDs, get in touch
* We'll hear more from him about how it went in the feedback section today \*\*\*

### [Swap encryption in DragonFly](http://lists.dragonflybsd.org/pipermail/users/2015-May/207690.html) ###

* Doing [full disk encryption](http://www.bsdnow.tv/tutorials/fde) is very important, but something that people sometimes overlook is encrypting their swap
* This can actually be *more* important than the contents of your disks, especially if an unencrypted password or key hits your swap (as it can be recovered quite easily)
* DragonFlyBSD has added a new experimental option to automatically encrypt your swap partition in fstab
* There was [another way](http://lists.dragonflybsd.org/pipermail/users/2015-May/207691.html) to do it previously, but this is a lot easier
* You can achieve similar results in FreeBSD by adding ".eli" to the end of the swap device in fstab, there are [a few steps](https://www.netbsd.org/docs/misc/#cgd-swap) to do it in NetBSD and swap in OpenBSD is encrypted by default
* A one-time key will be created and then destroyed in each case, making recovery of the plaintext nearly impossible \*\*\*

News Roundup

### [USB thermometer on OpenBSD](http://www.cambus.net/rding-temper-gold-usb-thermometer-on-openbsd/) ###

* So maybe you've got BSD on your server or router, maybe NetBSD on a toaster, but have you ever used a thermometer with one?
* This blog post introduces the RDing TEMPer Gold USB thermometer, a small device that can tell the room temperature, and how to get it working on OpenBSD
* Wouldn't you know it, OpenBSD has a native "[ugold](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man4/ugold.4)" driver to support it with the sensors framework
* How useful such a device would be is another story though \*\*\*

### [NAS4Free now on ARM](http://sourceforge.net/projects/nas4free/files/NAS4Free-ARM/10.1.0.2.1511/) ###

* We talk a lot about hardware for network-attached storage devices on the show, but ARM doesn't come up a lot
* That might be changing soon, as NAS4Free has just released some ARM builds
* These new (somewhat experimental) images are based on FreeBSD 11-CURRENT
* Included in the announcement is a list of fully-supported and partially-supported hardware that they've tested it with
* If anyone has experience with running a NAS on slightly exotic hardware, write in to us \*\*\*

### [pkgsrcCon 2015 CFP and info](http://pkgsrc.pub/pkgsrcCon/2015/) ###

* This year's pkgsrcCon will be in Berlin, Germany [on July 4th and 5th](https://mail-index.netbsd.org/pkgsrc-users/2015/05/16/msg021560.html)
* They're looking for talk proposals and ideas for things you'd like to see
* If you or your company uses pkgsrc, or if you're just interested in NetBSD in general, it would be a good event to check out \*\*\*

### [BSDTalk episode 253](http://bsdtalk.blogspot.com/2015/05/bsdtalk253-george-neville-neil.html) ###

* BSDTalk has released another new episode
* In it, he interviews George Neville-Neil about the 2nd edition of "The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System"
* They discuss what's new since the last edition, who the book's target audience is and a lot more
* We're up to 90 episodes now, slowly catching up to Will... \*\*\*
