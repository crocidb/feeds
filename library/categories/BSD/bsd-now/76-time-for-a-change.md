This week, we'll be talking to Henning Brauer about OpenNTPD and its recently revived portable version. After that, we'll be discussing different ways to securely tunnel your traffic: specifically OpenVPN, IPSEC, SSH and Tor. All that and the latest news, coming up on BSD Now - the place to B.. SD.

### [Strange timer bug in FreeBSD 11](https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-current/2015-February/054295.html) ###

* [Peter Wemm](http://www.bsdnow.tv/episodes/2014_09_24-beastly_infrastructure) wrote in to the FreeBSD -CURRENT mailing list with an interesting observation
* Running the latest development code in the infrastructure, the clock would stop keeping time after 24 days of uptime
* This meant things like cron and sleep would break, TCP/IP wouldn't time out or resend packets, a lot of things would break
* A workaround until it was fixed was to reboot every 24 days, but this is BSD we're talking about - uptime is our game
* An initial proposal was adding a CFLAG to the build options which makes makes signed arithmetic wrap
* Peter disagreed and [gave some background](https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-current/2015-February/054320.html), offering a different patch to [fix](https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/svn-src-head/2015-February/067827.html) the issue and [detect it early](https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/svn-src-head/2015-February/067828.html) if it happens again
* Ultimately, the problem was traced back to an issue with a recent clang import
* It only affected -CURRENT, not -RELEASE or -STABLE, but was definitely a bizarre bug to track down \*\*\*

### [An OpenBSD mail server](http://technoquarter.blogspot.com/p/series.html) ###

* There's been a recent influx of blog posts about building a BSD mail server for some reason
* In this fancy series of posts, the author sets up OpenSMTPD in its native OpenBSD home, whereas previous posts have been aimed at FreeBSD and Linux
* In addition to the usual steps, this one also covers DKIMproxy, ClamAV for scanning attachments, Dovecot for IMAP and also multiple choices of spam filtering: spamd or SpamAssassin
* It also shows you how to set up Roundcube for building a web interface, using the new in-base httpd
* That means this is more of a "complete solution" - right down to what the end users see
* The series is split up into categories so it's very easy to follow along step-by-step \*\*\*

### [How DragonFlyBSD uses git](http://lists.dragonflybsd.org/pipermail/users/2015-January/207421.html) ###

* DragonFlyBSD, along with PCBSD and EdgeBSD, uses git as its version control system for the system source code
* In a [series](http://lists.dragonflybsd.org/pipermail/users/2015-January/207422.html) of [posts](http://lists.dragonflybsd.org/pipermail/users/2015-January/207424.html), Matthew Dillon (the project lead) details their internal setup
* They're using vanilla git over ssh, with the developers' accounts set to git-only (no shell access)
* The maintainers of the server are the only ones with shell access available
* He also details how a cron job syncs from the master to a public box that anyone can check out code from
* It would be interesting to hear about how other BSD projects manage their master source repository \*\*\*

### [Why not try PCBSD?](http://www.itwire.com/business-it-news/open-source/66900-fed-up-with-systemd-and-linux?-why-not-try-pc-bsd) ###

* ITwire, another more mainstream tech site, published a recent article about switching to PCBSD
* They interview a guy named Kris that we've never heard of before
* In the article, they touch on how easy it can potentially be for Linux users looking to switch over to the BSD side - lots of applications are exactly the same
* "With the growing adoption of systemd, dissatisfaction with Linux has reached proportions not seen in recent years, to the extent that people have started talking of switching to FreeBSD."
* If you have some friends who complain to you about systemd all the time, this might be a good article to show them \*\*\*

News Roundup
----------

### [Authenticated time in OpenNTPD](https://www.marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&m=142356166731390&w=2) ###

* We recorded that interview with Henning just a few days ago, and it looks like part of it may be outdated *already*
* While at the hackathon, some developers came up with an [alternate way](https://www.marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&m=142355043928397&w=2) to get authenticated NTP responses
* You can now add an HTTPS URL to your ntpd.conf in addition to the time server pool
* OpenNTPD will query it (over TLS, with CA verification) and look at the date sent in the HTTPS header
* It's not intended to be a direct time source, just a constraint to keep things within reason
* If you receive regular NTP packets that are way off from the TLS packet, those will be discarded and the server(s) marked as invalid
* [Henning](https://www.marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&m=142363215730069&w=2) and [Theo](https://www.marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&m=142363400330522&w=2) also weigh in to give some of the backstory on the idea
* Lots more detail can be found in Reyk's email explaining the new feature (and it's optional of course) \*\*\*

### [NetBSD at Open Source Conference 2015 Oita and Hamanako](https://mail-index.netbsd.org/netbsd-advocacy/2015/02/08/msg000678.html) ###

* It's been a while since we've featured one of these trip reports, but the Japanese NetBSD users group is still doing them
* This time the conferences were in Oita [and Hamanako](https://mail-index.netbsd.org/netbsd-advocacy/2015/02/11/msg000679.html), Japan
* Machines running NetBSD included the CubieBoard2 Allwinner A20, Raspberry Pi and Banana Pi, Sharp NetWalker and a couple Zaurus devices
* As always, they took lots of pictures from the event of NetBSD on all these weird machines \*\*\*

### [Poudriere in a jail](http://www.tobeannounced.org/2015/02/poudriere-in-a-jail/) ###

* A common question we get about our [poudriere tutorial](http://www.bsdnow.tv/tutorials/poudriere) is "how do I run it in a jail?" - this blog post is about exactly that
* It takes you through the networking setup, zpool setup, nginx setup, making the jail and finally poking the right holes in the jail to allow poudriere to work its magic \*\*\*

### [Bruteblock, another way to stop bruteforce](http://easyos.net/articles/bsd/freebsd/bruteblock_protection_against_bruteforce_attacks_in_ssh) ###

* We've mentioned a few different ways to stop ssh bruteforce attempts in the past: fail2ban, denyhosts, or even just with pf's built-in rate limiting
* Bruteblock is a similar tool, but it's not just for ssh logins - it can do a number of other services
* It can also work directly with IPFW, which is a plus if you're using that as your firewall
* Add a few lines to your syslog.conf and bruteblock will get executed automatically
* The rest of the article takes you through the different settings you can configure for blocking \*\*\*

### [New iwm(4) driver and cross-polination](https://www.marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&m=142325218626853&w=2) ###

* The OpenBSD guys recently imported a new "iwm" driver for newer Intel 7260 wireless cards (commonly found in Thinkpads)
* NetBSD wasted no time in [porting it over](https://mail-index.netbsd.org/source-changes/2015/02/07/msg062979.html), giving a bit of interesting backstory
* According to [Antti Kantee](http://www.bsdnow.tv/episodes/2013_10_23-a_brief_intorduction), "it was created for OpenBSD by writing and porting a NetBSD driver which was developed in a rump kernel in Linux userspace"
* Both projects would appreciate further testing if you have the hardware and can provide useful bug reports
* Maybe FreeBSD and DragonFly will port it over too, or come up with something that's partially based on the code \*\*\*

### [PCBSD current images](http://blog.pcbsd.org/2015/02/pc-bsd-11-0-current-images-now-available/) ###

* The first PCBSD -CURRENT images should be available this weekend
* This image will be tagged 11.0-CURRENTFEB2015, with planned monthly updates
* For the more adventurous this will allow testing both FreeBSD and PCBSD bleeding edge \*\*\*
