Headlines
----------

### [NetBSD 7.1 released](http://www.netbsd.org/releases/formal-7/NetBSD-7.1.html) ###

* This update represents a selected subset of fixes deemed important for security or stability reasons, as well as new features and enhancements.
* Kernel

  * [compat\_linux(8)](http://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?compat_linux+8.i386+NetBSD-7.1): Fully support sched\_setaffinity and sched\_getaffinity, fixing, e.g., the Intel Math Kernel Library.

* DTrace:

  * Avoid redefined symbol errors when loading the module.
  * Fix module autoload.

* IPFilter:

  * Fix matching of ICMP queries when NAT'd through IPF.
  * Fix lookup of original destination address when using a redirect rule. This is required for transparent proxying by squid, for example.
  * [ipsec(4)](http://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?ipsec+4.i386+NetBSD-7.1): Fix NAT-T issue with NetBSD being the host behind NAT.

* Drivers

  * Add vioscsi driver for the Google Compute Engine disk.
  * [ichsmb(4)](http://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?ichsmb+4.i386+NetBSD-7.1): Add support for Braswell CPU and Intel 100 Series.
  * [wm(4)](http://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?wm+4.i386+NetBSD-7.1):
  * Add C2000 KX and 2.5G support.
  * Add Wake On Lan support.
  * Fixed a lot of bugs

* Security Fixes

  * [NetBSD-SA2017-001](http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/security/advisories/NetBSD-SA2017-001.txt.asc) Memory leak in the connect system call.
  * [NetBSD-SA2017-002](http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/security/advisories/NetBSD-SA2017-002.txt.asc) Several vulnerabilities in ARP.

* ARM related

  * Support for Raspberry Pi Zero.
  * ODROID-C1 Ethernet now works.

  * Improving documentation and other minor system parts
  * Documentation of ptrace(2) and explanation how debuggers work
  * Introduction of new siginfo(2) codes for SIGTRAP
  * New ptrace(2) interfaces

* What has been done in LLDB

* Native Process NetBSD Plugin

* The MonitorCallback function

* Other LLDB code, out of the NativeProcessNetBSD Plugin

* Automated LLDB Test Results Summary

* Plan for the next milestone

  * fix conflict with system-wide py-six
  * add support for auxv read operation
  * switch resolution of pid -\> path to executable from /proc to sysctl(7)
  * recognize Real-Time Signals (SIGRTMIN-SIGRTMAX)
  * upstream !NetBSDProcessPlugin code
  * switch std::call\_once to llvm::call\_once
  * add new ptrace(2) interface to lock and unlock threads from execution
  * switch the current PT\_WATCHPOINT interface to PT\_GETDBREGS and PT\_SETDBREGS

### [Actually building a FreeBSD Phone ](https://hackaday.io/project/13145-bsd-based-secure-smartphone) ###

* There have been a number of different projects that have proposed building a FreeBSD based smart phone
* This project is a bit different, and I think that gives it a better chance to make progress
* It uses off-the-shelf parts, so while not as neatly integrated as a regular smartphone device, it makes a much better prototype, and is more readily available.
* Hardware overview: X86-based, long-lasting (user-replaceable) battery, WWAN Modem (w/LTE), 4-5" LCD Touchscreen (Preferably w/720p resolution, IPS), upgradable storage.
* Currently targeting the UDOO Ultra platform. It features Intel Pentium N3710 (2.56GHz Quad-core, HD Graphics 405 [16 EUs @ 700MHz], VT-x, AES-NI), 2x4GB DDR3L RAM, 32GB eMMC storage built-in, further expansion w/M.2 SSD & MicroSD slot, lots of connectivity onboard.
* Software: FreeBSD Hypervisor (bhyve or Xen) to run atop the hardware, hosting two separate hosts.
  * One will run an instance of pfSense, the "World's Most Popular Open Source Firewall" to handle the WWAN connection, routing, and Firewall (as well as Secure VPN if desired).
  * The other instance will run a slimmed down installation of FreeBSD. The UI will be tweaked to work best in this form factor & resources tuned for this platform. There will be a strong reliance on Google Chromium & Google's services (like Google Voice).

* The project has a detailed log, and it looks like the hardware it is based on will ship in the next few weeks, so we expect to see more activity. \*\*\*

News Roundup
----------

### [NVME M.2 card road tests (Matt Dillon)](http://lists.dragonflybsd.org/pipermail/users/2017-March/313261.html) ###

* DragonFlyBSD’s Matt Dillon has posted a rundown of the various M.2 NVMe devices he has tested
  * SAMSUNG 951
  * SAMSUNG 960 EVO
  * TOSHIBA OCZ RD400
  * INTEL 600P
  * WD BLACK 256G
  * MYDIGITALSSD
  * PLEXTOR M8Pe

* It is interesting to see the relative performance of each device, but also how they handle the workload and manage their temperature (or don’t in a few cases)
* The link provides a lot of detail about different block sizes and overall performance \*\*\*

### [ZREP ZFS replication and failover](http://www.bolthole.com/solaris/zrep/) ###

* "zrep", a robust yet easy to use ZFS based replication and failover solution. It can also serve as the conduit to create a simple backup hub.
* The tool was originally written for Solaris, and is written in ksh
* However, it seems people have used it on FreeBSD and even FreeNAS by installing the ksh93 port
* Has anyone used this? How does it compare to tools like zxfer?
* There is a FreeBSD port, but it is a few versions behind, someone should update it
* We would be interested in hearing some feedback \*\*\*
