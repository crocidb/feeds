Headlines
----------

### [Bitrig 1.0 released](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.os.bitrig.devel/6) ###

* If you haven't heard of it, [Bitrig](https://www.bitrig.org/) is a fork of OpenBSD that started a couple years ago
* According to [their FAQ](https://github.com/bitrig/bitrig/wiki/Faq), some of their goals include: only supporting modern hardware and a limited set of CPU architectures, replacing nearly all GNU tools in base with BSD versions and having better virtualization support
* They've finally announced their first official release, 1.0
* This release introduces support for Clang 3.4, replacing the old GCC, along with libc++ replacing the GNU version
* It also includes filesystem journaling, support for GPT and - most importantly - a hacker-style console with green text on black background
* One of the developers [answered some questions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8701936) about it on Hacker News too \*\*\*

### [Is it time to try BSD?](http://www.technewsworld.com/story/81424.html) ###

* Here we get a little peek into the Linux world - more and more people are considering switching
* On a more mainstream tech news site, they have an article about people switching away from Linux and to BSD
* People are starting to get even more suspicious of systemd, and lots of drama in the Linux world is leading a whole new group of potential users over to the BSD side
* This article explores some pros and cons of switching, and features opinions of various users \*\*\*

### [Poudriere 3.1 released](https://github.com/freebsd/poudriere/wiki/release_notes_31) ###

* One of the first things we ever covered on the show was [poudriere](http://www.bsdnow.tv/tutorials/poudriere), a tool with a funny name that's used to build binary packages from FreeBSD ports
* It's come a long way since then, and [bdrewery](http://www.bsdnow.tv/episodes/2014_07_16-network_iodometry) and [bapt](http://www.bsdnow.tv/episodes/2014_01_01-eclipsing_binaries) have just announced a new major version
* This new release features a redesigned web interface to check on the status of your packages
* There are lots of new bulk building options to preserve packages even if some fail to compile - this makes maintaining a production repo much easier
* It also introduces a useful new "pkgclean" subcommand to clean out your repository of packages that aren't needed anymore, and poudriere keeps it cleaner by default as well now
* Check the full release notes for all the additions and bug fixes \*\*\*

### [Firewalling with OpenBSD's pf and pfsync](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN5E2EYJnrw) ###

* A talk by David Gwynne from an Australian conference was uploaded, with the subject matter being pf and pfsync
* He uses pf to manage 60 internal networks with a single firewall
* The talk gives some background on how pf originally came to be and some OpenBSD 101 for the uninitiated
* It also touches on different rulesets, use cases, configuration syntax, placing limits on connections, ospf, authpf, segregating VLANs, synproxy handling and a lot more
* The second half of the presentation focuses on pfsync and carp for failover and redundancy
* With two BSD boxes running pfsync, you can actually *patch your kernel and still stay connected to IRC* \*\*\*

### [The long tail of MD5](http://www.tedunangst.com/flak/post/the-long-tail-of-MD5) ###

* In this blog post, he goes through some of the different areas where MD5 still lives, and discovers how easy (or impossible) it would be to replace
* Through some recent commits, OpenBSD now uses SHA512 in some places that you might not expect
* [Some other places](https://www.marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&m=141763065223567&w=4) require a bit more care… \*\*\*
