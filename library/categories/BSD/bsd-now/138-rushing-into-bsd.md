News Roundup
----------

### [Write opinionated workarounds](http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2016-04-11-write-opinionated-workarounds.html) ###

* Colin Percival has written a great blog post this past week, specifically talking about his policy of writing “opinionated workarounds”.
* The idea came about due to his working on multi-platform software, and the frustrations of dealing with POSIX violations
* The crux of the post is how he deals with these workarounds. Specifically by *only* applying them to the particular system in which it was required. And doing so loudly.
* This has some important benefits. First, it doesn’t potentially expose other systems to bugs / security flaws when a workaround doesn’t “work” on a system for which it wasn’t designed. Secondly it’s important to complain. Loudly. This lets the user know that they are running on a system that doesn’t adhere to POSIX compliance, and maybe even get the attention of a developer who could remedy the situation. \*\*\*

### [Privilege escalation in calendar(1)](http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/security/advisories/NetBSD-SA2016-003.txt.asc) ###

* File this one under “Ouch that hurts” a new security vuln has been posted, this time against NetBSD’s ‘calendar’ command.
* Specifically it looks like some of the daily scripts uses the ‘-a’ flag, which requires super-user privs in order to process all users calendar files and mail the results.
* However the bug occurred because the calendar command didn’t drop priv properly before executing external commands (whoops!)
* To workaround you can set run\_calendar=NO in the daily.conf file, or apply the fixed binary from upstream. \*\*\*

### [PGCon 2016](http://www.pgcon.org/2016/) ###

* PGCon 2016 is now only 4 weeks away
* The conference will be held at the University of Ottawa (same venue as BSDCan) from May 17th to 20th
* Tutorials: 17-18 May 2016 (Tue & Wed)
* Talks: 19-20 May 2016 (Thu-Fri)
* Wednesday is a developer unconference.
* Saturday is a user unconference.
* “PGCon is an annual conference for users and developers of PostgreSQL, a leading relational database, which just happens to be open source. PGCon is the place to meet, discuss, build relationships, learn valuable insights, and generally chat about the work you are doing with PostgreSQL. If you want to learn why so many people are moving to PostgreSQL, PGCon will be the place to find out why. Whether you are a casual user or you've been working with PostgreSQL for years, PGCon will have something for you.”
* New to PGSQL? Just a user? Long time developers? This conference has something for you. [A great lineup of talks](https://www.pgcon.org/2016/schedule/events.en.html), plus unconference days focused on both users and developers \*\*\*
