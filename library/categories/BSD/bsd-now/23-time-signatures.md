Headlines

### [FreeBSD foundation's 2013 fundraising results](http://freebsdfoundation.blogspot.com/2014/01/freebsd-foundation-announces-2013.html) ###

* The FreeBSD foundation finally counted all the money they made in 2013
* **$768,562 from 1659 donors**
* Nice little blog post from the team with a giant beastie picture
* "We have already started our 2014 fundraising efforts. As of the end of January we are just under $40,000. Our goal is to raise $1,000,000. We are currently finalizing our 2014 budget. We plan to publish both our 2013 financial report and our 2014 budget soon."
* A special thanks to all the BSD Now listeners that contributed, the foundation was really glad that we sent some people their way (and they mentioned us on Facebook) \*\*\*

### [OpenSSH 6.5 released](https://lists.mindrot.org/pipermail/openssh-unix-dev/2014-January/032152.html) ###

* We mentioned the CFT last week, and it's [finally here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7154925)!
* New key exchange using elliptic-curve Diffie Hellman in Daniel Bernstein's Curve25519 (now the default when both clients support it)
* Ed25519 public keys are now available for host keys and user keys, considered more secure than DSA and ECDSA
* Funny side effect: if you ONLY enable ed25519 host keys, all the compromised Linux boxes [can't even attempt to login](http://slexy.org/view/s2rI13v8F4) lol\~
* New bcrypt private key type, 500,000,000 times harder to brute force
* Chacha20-poly1305 transport cipher that builds an encrypted and authenticated stream in one
* Portable version [already in](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&revision=261320) FreeBSD -CURRENT, [and ports](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports?view=revision&sortby=date&revision=342618)
* Lots more bugfixes and features, see the full release note or [our interview](http://www.bsdnow.tv/episodes/2013_12_18-cryptocrystalline) with Damien
* Work has already started on 6.6, which [can be used without OpenSSL](https://twitter.com/msfriedl/status/427902493176377344)! \*\*\*

### [Crazed Ferrets in a Berkeley Shower](http://blather.michaelwlucas.com/archives/1942) ###

* In 2000, [MWL](http://www.bsdnow.tv/episodes/2013_11_06-year_of_the_bsd_desktop) wrote an essay for linux.com about why he uses the BSD license: "It’s actually stood up fairly well to the test of time, but it’s fourteen years old now."
* This is basically an updated version about why he uses the BSD license, in response to recent [comments from Richard Stallman](http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2014-01/msg00247.html)
* Very nice post that gives some history about Berkeley, the basics of the BSD-style licenses and their contrast to the GNU GPL
* Check out the full post if you're one of those people that gets into license arguments
* The takeaway is "BSD is about making the world a better place. For everyone." \*\*\*

### [OpenBSD on BeagleBone Black](http://www.tedunangst.com/flak/post/OpenBSD-on-BeagleBone-Black) ###

* Beaglebone Blacks are cheap little ARM devices similar to a Raspberry Pi
* A blog post about installing OpenBSD on a BBB from.. our guest for today!
* He describes it as "everything I wish I knew before installing the newly renamed armv7 port on a BeagleBone Black"
* It goes through the whole process, details different storage options and some workarounds
* Could be a really fun weekend project if you're interested in small or embedded devices \*\*\*
