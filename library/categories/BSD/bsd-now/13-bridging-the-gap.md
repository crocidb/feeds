* He actually maintains the .dk ccTLD
* Describes FreeBSD as "the best well-hidden success story in operating systems, by now in the hands of more people than one can count and used by even more people, and not one of them knows it! It’s not only the best operating system currently around, but also the most supportive and inspiring community."
* In [the next one](http://blogs.freebsdish.org/portmgr/2013/11/25/getting-to-know-your-portmgr-martin-wilke/) they speak with Martin Wilke (miwi@)
* The usual, "what inspires you about FreeBSD" "how did you get into it" etc. \*\*\*

Tutorial
----------

### [Building an OpenBSD router, part 2](http://www.bsdnow.tv/tutorials/openbsd-router) ###

* **Note: there was a mistake in the video version of the tutorial, please consult the written version for the proper instructions.** \*\*\*

News Roundup
----------

### [pfSense 2.1 on AWS EC2](http://blog.pfsense.org/?p=1132) ###

* We now have pfSense 2.1 available on Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
* In keeping with the community spirit, they’re also offering a free "public" AMI
* Check the FAQ and User Guide on their site for additional details
* Interesting possibilities with pfSense in the cloud \*\*\*

### [Puffy on the desktop](http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20131118#feature) ###

* Distrowatch, a primarily Linux-focused site, features an OpenBSD 5.4 review
* They talk about using it on the desktop, how to set it up
* Very long write-up, curious Linux users should give it a read
* Ends with "Most people will still see OpenBSD as an operating system for servers and firewalls, but OpenBSD can also be used in desktop environments if the user doesn't mind a little manual work. The payoff is a very light, responsive system that is unlikely to ever misbehave" \*\*\*

### [Two-factor authentication with SSH](http://cmacr.ae/openbsd/security/networking/2013/11/25/ssh-yubi.html) ###

* Blog post about using a yubikey with SSH public keys
* Uses a combination of a OTP, BSDAuth and OpenBSD's login.conf, but it can be used with PAM on other systems as well
* Allows for two-factor authentication (a la gmail) in case your private key is compromised
* Anyone interested in an extra-hardened SSH server should give it a read \*\*\*

### [PCBSD weekly digest](http://blog.pcbsd.org/2013/11/weekly-feature-digest-112313/) ###

* 10.0 has approximately 400 PBIs for public consumption
* They will be merging the GNOME3, MATE and Cinnamon desktops into the 10.0 ports tree - please help test them, this is pretty big news in and of itself!
* PCDM is coming along nicely, more bugs are getting fixed
* Added ZFS dataset options to PCBSD’s new text installer front-end \*\*\*
